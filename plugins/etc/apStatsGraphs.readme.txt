Change Log
==========

v1.0.4
    * Fixed OFC vulnerability reported at http://osvdb.org/59051 (again):
      when upgrading from a previous version the affected file was left in
      place by the OpenX plugin framework instead of being deleted,
      effectively leaving the instance still vulnerable. This fix adds back
      an empty file with the same name, to work around the aforementioned
      OpenX bug.

v1.0.3
    * Fixed OFC vulnerability reported at http://osvdb.org/59051

    * Properly fixed the issue with scientific notation: the previous fix was
      generating a malformed JSON response.
    * Added built-in update checker

v1.0.1
    * Fixed compatibility issue with PHP < 5.2
    * Fixed problem with very big numbers breaking OFC, as it currently cannot
      deal with the scientific notation that is used by default by json_encode
